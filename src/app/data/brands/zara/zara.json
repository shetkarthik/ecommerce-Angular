        "para":"Zara is a Spanish clothes and accessories brand, it is the flagship brand of the Inditex group. Few clothing brands keep up with the latest fashion, are of high quality and yet, affordable. It is probably the amalgamation of all these qualities that made Zara, the Spanish clothing brand become the go-to fashion brand for all.By the 1990’s the store had expanded into the United States, France and most of the Europe. Today, Zara has close to 6500 stores across 88 countries around the world.",

        "cpara":"By tapping into the universal sense of wanderlust that's been brewing during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zara's Spring/Summer '21 campaign effectively teleports shoppers to a far away desert mirage. The latest collection, titled Into The Light, from the Spanish brand swaps out its signature contemporary and edgy aesthetic for a softer one that relies on the magic of escapism — and the entire campaign is a love letter addressed to the leading spring 2021 color trends. Best of all, Zara's fashion picks for the season — think fluid silhouettes, sumptuous colors, and silk materials — make your sunshine-filled fantasy feel all the more realistic."
